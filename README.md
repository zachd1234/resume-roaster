# Resume Roaster 🔥✨

An AI agent that tells you the brutal truth about your resume — then gives you a glow-up version that might actually get you hired.

Built during the **Sentient Foundation Hackathon**, this project combines language model critique with persuasive resume rewrites, all wrapped in a conversational agent.

## 🎯 What It Does

1. **Step 1: Roast It**  
   The agent brutally analyzes your resume, highlighting flaws, cringe wording, and corporate-speak.

2. **Step 2: Rewrite It**  
   It then generates a clean, sharp, recruiter-friendly version that’s much more likely to get attention.

## 🤖 Built With
- **Sentient Agent Framework** (Python)
- **OpenAI GPT (via Sentient Chat Events)**
- Modular agent architecture for message handling
- Agent-to-client integration via submodules

## 🛠️ How It Works
- The user submits a resume (plain text or upload)
- Agent 1 (Critique Agent) responds with a roast-style breakdown
- Agent 2 (Rewrite Agent) responds with a professional rewrite
- Messages are passed via Sentient Chat using the agent framework
